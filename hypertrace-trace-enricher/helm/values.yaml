#
# Note about Namespace
# --------------------
# It is deliberately left out here and using the helm -n or --namespace flag you can deploy your resources to the same
# namespace as the release. If you leave it out, your resources will be deployed to the default namespace.
# Also, not that the namespace you are deploying to should already exist otherwise the helm command will fail.
# You can always specify a different namespace for a resource by setting it directly in it's yaml file or
# making it configurable by defining it in this file.

resources:
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

# The Deployment Selector match labels are different from the pod labels. Note that they should be a subset of the pod
# labels. You append new labels to them but cannot remove labels. If you remove or modify the labels you will need to
# delete the existing deployment bearing the same name and then redeploy. This is the reason why they are separated from
# the pod labels. You can add and remove pod labels without having an effect on the deployment.
# Also, please use "apiVersion: apps/v1" instead of the deprecated "apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1" for the deployment
# apiVersion in the yaml file.
